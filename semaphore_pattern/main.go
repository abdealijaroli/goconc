	//12: the current i and xi are passed to the closure as parameters, masking the i and xi variables from the outer for-loop. This allows each goroutine to have its own copy of i and xi; otherwise, the next iteration of the for-loop would update i and xi in all goroutines. On the other hand, the res slice is not passed to the closure, since each goroutine does not need a separate copy of it. The res slice is part of the closureâ€™s environment but is not a parameter.

	// each iteration in the for-loop is done in parallel:
	for i, v := range data {
		go func(i int, v float64) {
			doSomething(i, v)
		}(i, v)
	}
}
