Concurrency patterns in Go.
- I have been learning Go for a while now and also reading a lot about concurrency patterns in Go. I decided to document some of the patterns I have come across and understood. This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the patterns that exist in Go. I will keep updating this document as I learn more about concurrency patterns in Go. I hope this document helps you understand concurrency patterns in Go better.

- Each package is named after the pattern it implements. Every package contains a main.go file which demonstrates the pattern. The main.go file also contains comments explaining the pattern and how it is implemented. 

- I hope you find this repo useful. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me. I would love to hear from you.
